subsys_picketlink_identity_provider_desc=Within a federation, applications and organizations play one or both of two roles: identity provider and/or service provider.  The identity provider is the authoritative entity responsible for authenticating an end user and asserting an identity for that user in a trusted fashion to trusted partners.
subsys_picketlink_service_provider_desc=The service provider relies on the identity provider to assert information about a user via an electronic user credential, leaving the service provider to manage access control and dissemination based on a trusted set of user credential assertions.
